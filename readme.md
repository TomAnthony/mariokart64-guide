# Introduction

This guide is written for racing against human players. It doesn't cover battle at all. I race with Yoshi / Peach / Toad so there may be some things that don't work so well with the other characters.

This guide doesn't include finding the best racing line asides from notable exceptions, so you need to learn that.

Some parts assume your opponents are good racers too - if they aren't then the other tips will mean you win fairly easily. :)

Our house rules mean you can't use any course glitches which you can't make a case were designed in to the game. For example, the wall glitch on Wario Stadium is not permitted, but the Yoshi jump down is allowed.

Finally, we play using the UK version of the game running on an original N64 using an Everdrive. We have a Gameshark code to allow multiple players as the same character but no other mods or patches. None of that should affect any of the stuff in here but you never know.

# Base Skills

The techniques in this section are things anyone who has been racing for a while should have already learned. Anyone with experience can skip these.

- Power sliding - you need to learn to power slide. You can get a mini-boost from these once you get good, and when you get really good you can strafe around objects with it.
- Starting boost - learn when to accelerate at the start of the race to get a boost (just after the second light comes on). However, often there is no benefit to doing this. Going round the first corner in first place is not a good predictor of final placing.
- You can single or chains of bananas forward. It is hard to do but with practice this can be useful for slowing people down.
- You can prevent spinning out if you hit a banana by tapping your break (you need to have hit it straight on for this to work). You can actually do this without letting go of the accelerator too, but it doesn't seem to make much difference. You can also avoid spinning out by letting off the accelerator.
- Firing a red in first place creates a 'circler' that will just go round and round the course until it hits something. This can be useful in first place as it will need to pass the other players on the next lap before it gets to you so you'll have a warning (if you've stayed in first) but they won't.
- You can hold both A & B to spin on the spot, which is useful for getting out of corners or manoeuvring around obstacles
- You can hold down the trigger to drag objects behind you, these will still hurt other players that touch them, but will also act as defence for green and red shells coming from behind (as most do). A shell being dragged can still be fired, and a banana still thrown. Dragging objects also frees up your object box for collecting another item.
- You can fire green shells backwards by pull back on the control stick when you fire.
- After you pick up a box, you can speed up 'locking in' the weapon by pulling the trigger. This works a few seconds after picking up a box.

# Driving Techniques

- After being hit by anything triple tap the accelerator to go back to full speed instantly.
- You can hop over bombs on the track if you get the timing right. You shouldn't plan to do this usually as it is easy to mess up but can save you if you don't have time to move around it.
- Learn to steal boxes from players who are just behind you. Learn their preferred boxes and routes and look where they are to anticipate which box they want and steal it just before so they get no weapon. Box denying is critical against good opponents to eek out an advantage.
- If you are being shot at with a red as you're getting close to the finishing line on the last lap, make sure you orient your kart directly towards the line so if you get hit you might roll over the line.
- [**Advanced**] If you see an obstacle, such as a box, on your path within a short distance it can be hard to avoid. You can use a hop to change direction more quickly to 'hop around' these obstacles. With practice this can be done quite late.
- [**Advanced**] A nice way to steal boxes is using a power slide, where you are tilted (moving forward but facing at an angle) to suddenly boost sideways across the track taking the boxes before they can change course for another box.
- [**_Expert_**] You can strafe left and right whilst power sliding to adjust your cornering for items on the course.

# Weapon Use

## Defence

- If there is a ghost in play and you are 4th (or 3rd) and you pick up a weapon, the player with the ghost often tries to anticipate when you're weapon will lock-in and steal it before you can use it. In this situation you should use your trigger in a non-deterministic fashion to randomly speed up the lock-in.
- [**Advanced**] When there is a lightning in play, modify your racing line in such a way that the spin out will not take you off the course.
- [**Advanced**] When there is a lightning in play, modify your racing line in such a way that the spin out will not take you off the course.
- [**Advanced**] It is possible to shoot obstacles out of your way. Bananas or boxes on ramps or beiges can be shot away with any type of shell which can be critical at times.
- [**Advanced**] You can use a trail of bananas to stop multiple incoming shells (e.g. a red shell double tap), by laying one of the bananas just before the shells reach you. Use other people's screens to judge.
- It is possible to ‘drop’ hunt the leaders.
	- Normal shells/bananas/boxes you are dragging won’t protect you, but dragging a hunt the leader will. Especially useful on Beach / Luigi’s where you can get a hunt the leader easily.
	- The easiest way to do this is by hoping over any sort of water (e.g on Penguins) or ledge (e.g on Banshee), when the shell is getting close to you. It will hit the corner and disappear. You can also use walls where there is a tight turn (e.g. the turret on Bowsers) or you can turn very sharply round an angled corner. With practice you'll find many spots that work.
	- [**Advanced**] You can avoid hunt the leaders for a lap by 'hiding' on offload parts of the course as it comes up behind you. It'll pass by and go all the way around the course so don't forget about it in a laps time when it turns up again (a fact that you can use tactically with practice). I've documented some of the places you can do this for certain courses but there are more places.
[**Advanced**] Learn several racing lines on courses and use them in a non-deterministic fashion. This means it's harder for an attack to place weapons on 'your' line.
	- [**_Expert_**] It is also possible to drop hunt the leader shells by having it hit another player (i.e. the player in second). They have to be close to you for this to work.
- [**Advanced**] Learn several racing lines on courses and use them in a non-deterministic fashion. This means it's harder for an attack to place weapons on 'your' line.
- [**Advanced**] If someone lightnings you just before a jump with a dead zone (Frappe, Bowsers) and you are still sliding you can hop just as you go over the edge and can sometimes clear the fall.
- [**Advanced**] When ghosted, shells do not chase you, but you can still hit shells and destroy them as though invincible. A good usage of this is to ghost a weapon when close to a player armed with shells just in front of you and then try to bash into the player. You won’t collide with the player as you are ghosted but you will strip any spinning or trailing shells.
- [**Advanced**] If someone 'double taps' (see attack section) you when you are dragging a defence use their screen to judge when the shells are going to hit so you can prep a second object for defending the second shell. If you are dragging a red then you need to wait for the first shell to hit you, but if you have a banana, box or green you can drop/fire backwards your defence just before the first attack shell arrives and it will hit that defence and be neutralised - you then have more time to get next defence object out.
- [*Experimental*] You can defend against an incoming shell by laying a banana just before the shell hits you. This can result in the shell being destroyed but the banana surviving and being laid on the track.

## Attack

- If you have multiple reds (either spinning or one dragged and one in your box) [or greens] and the person in front of you is dragging a defence object you can 'double tap' them by firing both shells in very quick succession you can strip their defence and hit them. Do it quickly as a skilled player will be able to double defend if there is a gap between the attack shells.
- Learn to use other's screens to aim your green shells when shooting backwards. On straights you can steer slightly left or right to hit people at an angle.
- Use single or sets of greens and bounce them off walls at a tight angle so they bounce back and forth to create trouble for those behind you. We call these 'tormentors'. Particularly useful on any small bridges or tunnels.
- You can also fire greens directly forward in tunnels just before you turn off so they bounce back directly oncoming for those behind you in the tunnel.
- An obvious good place to place fake boxes is on top of a real box thus making it harder for opponents to see.
- It can often be beneficial to and slightly hang back in a tight pack. This will allow you to get a last placed box which may be a lightning/invicible which would allow you to pull away. A good example of this is the first set of boxes on any course.
- [**Advanced**] If someone ahead of you goes off the course, on some courses you can overtake that person but the positions won't update until they are returned to the course. If you lock a box in during this time you'll get a better weapon.
- [**Advanced**] If you have a string of bananas, quickly spread them across the entire path in quick succession perpendicular to the course meaning opponents can't just stick to one side of the track to avoid them.
- [**Advanced**] When someone is dragging an object as defence, you can still hit them with a shell if you get it to hit their sides/front. Back shells are obviously the easiest way, but you can also hit their sides from behind them. A red shell shoots forward when you fire it so if you fire it at the right angle it will fire forwards then hit the player from the side bypassing their defence.
- [**Advanced**] If you are chasing someone to shoot a red but are struggling to get in range then you can fire before clearing a corner by taking outside line or by steering to face away from inside wall so the fired shell's turning circle means it clears the corner and chases the player.
- [**Advanced**] When dragging a hunt the leader, the shell swings around to in front of you when you fire it. Because it can blast through multiple opponents you can use this to your advantage by swinging it into a racer just in front of you to take both them and the leader out.
- [**Advanced**] You can lay boxes that hover in the air, this is a great way to make people fall down (e.g. on the jumps on Bowser or Frappe, or the cave ramp on Beach). This won't work on jumps with zippers (like Royal).
- [**Advanced**] When you ghost another player’s weapon there is a short period where they cannot pick up a new weapon from boxes. You can use this to strategically prevent a player behind you getting a good weapon. This works especially well for heads up.
- [**_Expert_**] With practice it is possible to shoot someone with a red (or even a green, but v. probabilistic) who is dragging a defence weapon but timing your shot for when they are going over some sort of jump. The shell will land just before they do so they land on it and it circumvents their defence.

# Course Tips

## Luigi Raceway (Luigi)

This course is hard to differentiate yourself on and good weapons often win the day. In a tight pack you should hang back just picking up last place boxes waiting for a killer weapon then keep it in reserve to the last moment. A lightning or a star will serve you very well if used after the tunnel on last lap.  A golden boost can also do well given how much you gain by cutting off the corners and going over the grass.

If in a pack with a wider array of skills then you can't afford to stay back and so need to stay near the front but not in 1st. Ideally 2nd. Then use the same principle as above. Try to get some shells or anything that can hurt 1st at the last moment, but be careful to defend behind you too.

-The box suspended under the balloon on the home straight always contains a hunt the leader shell, although you have to get lucky to arrive at the lowest point of the balloon's motion.

## Moo Moo Farm (Moo Moo)

Another course where a good weapon can make a big difference, but not as bad as Luigi!

-You can drop red shells by driving close to/around the pillars on the course.

## Koopa Trooper Beach (Beach)

- The box on top of the hill after the big ramp is a guaranteed hunt the leader shell. This can be vital if you've fallen behind, and with practice can be used to hit someone as they are going for the cave jump.
- If you get hit by a lightning as you're about to take the cave jump, and you have boosts, then you can position yourself on the ramp to wait to get big. Do NOT use the accelerator when you get big, but instead click the trigger repeatedly until your boost activates. Your accelerator activates before your weapons, and you'll roll off the ramp before the boosts can work.
- [**Advanced**] You should know there backup route for if you can't take the cave jump route. You should also realise it can be faster to go to the right of the right side of the archway rather than under the archway then to the right.
- [**Advanced**] If you are being chased by a hunt the leader you can ditch it by crossing the sand dune on the right after the archway (means you can't take the tunnel route though). Timed right the shell will pass by you as it takes the main route. Be aware of it coming for you in a laps time!
- [**Advanced**] After the first corner you can break left to go round a little side route or take the 'main' course. The side route is not only quicker with practice but also treats you as being behind the racers on the main course, so you can get a better weapon with the right timing.
- [**Advanced**] If you are hit before the jump then a triple tap to get to full speed and a hop at the the end of the ramp will be enough to get you into the tunnel with the light characters.
- [**Advanced**] If a hunt the leader is coming, you can avoid it by going around the little mountain to the left after the first turn of the course. The shell will go by and you'll be safe until it does another lap. Timing takes practice, but if you are in the right area this can be a good time saver. Don’t forget it will come back round (but with practice you’ll know when to expect it and can use that strategically).
- [**Advanced**] A box can be placed hanging in mid air just before the entrace to the cave which can obstruct people (and is more hidden than on the accelerator)
- [**_Expert_**] If you cross the start line a little ways out in the water the position ordering gets confused and puts you in a lower position (e.g 2nd instead of 1st) for a moment. You can grab a box from the ramps before and then lock it in at the moment you are in the lower position for a better weapon.
- [**_Expert_**] If you cross the start line a little ways out in the water the position ordering gets confused and puts you in a lower position (e.g 2nd instead of 1st) for a moment. You can grab a box from the ramps before and then lock it in at the moment you are in the lower position for a better weapon. You can also avoid red/hunt the leader shells that would be fired at you, if you pass through this point at the moment your opponent fires.
- [**Advanced**] A box can be placed hanging in mid air just before the entrace to the cave which can obstruct people (and is more hidden than on the accelerator)

## Kalimari Desert (Kalimari)

- After the second train track crossing it is quicker to break left across the dirt and power slide than to follow the track. Even more so with mushrooms or invincibility.
- [**Advanced**] If being chased by a hunt the leader cross the dirt after the second train crossing also has the benefit that it will pass you by for that lap. Requires being in the right place at the right time. Bear it in mind when attacking.

## Toad’s Turnpike (Toad’s)

- If you are leading with an incoming hunt the leader you should use the screen of the player in second place to assess the safety of going into the layby for a weapons box. Getting hit by a hunt the leader in the layby has a high risk of knocking you out of the course.
- [**Advanced**] Make sure you take all the boxes in each layby if you have someone close behind to deny them a box. You can power slide and boost out.

## Frappe Snowland (Frappe)

- A well timed lightning attack before the jump over the ice river (just before the snowman field) will slide the player up the ramp and they’ll fall in the water losing more time. If you are leading and the likely target you should either let the second place over take you or try to break and speed up suddenly to throw off timing.
- There is a glitch where if you go over the bridge at the end of the course with invincibility there's a chance you'll fall through the bridge into the river. If you have a star power, consider saving it until after the bridge.
- [**Advanced**] If you are being chased by reds on the snowman field you should go to the right of the giant snowman and they will hit him and you'll be ok.
- [**_Expert_**] The snowman field is flat and open and leaves you open to red shell attacks. After the snowman field is a bend which you can cut off by driving over before you go through the valley. It is possible to shake off red shells and hunt the leader shells by driving up the right hand side of the valley then jumping down after the shells have hit the wall below you. Don't go too far from the edge or too high or you'll be marked out of the course.

## Choco Mountain (Choco)

- It is best to time lightning attacks on the corner where people can fall down.
- Bananas on the big corner will force opponents to slow down even if they do not make them slip off.
- [**Advanced**] If there are multiple lightnings in play and another player tries to lightning people off on the corner, you can use your lightning to make them slide even farther if they haven’t already gone down. Rare scenario but can be tactically v. useful.
- [**Advanced**] A hunt the leader shell will climb up the jump so if you fire it at the right time it catches the leader much quicker.
- [**Advanced**] There are points on the track where you can fire reds which climb walls and so can hit people way ahead. Use the map to judge / learn.
- [**Advanced**] If you have a green shell and an opponent just behind you whilst going around the big corner, you can pull in and fire whilst they overtake. The direction and force of the the shell will knock them off.

## Mario Raceway (Mario)

- A golden mushroom or star can be huge on this course; the whole section of the track before the tunnel at the end lends itself to having the corners cut off.

## Wario Stadium (Wario)

Very rarely race this in multiplayer because it is so long.

- You need to learn to lightning people as they go for the big jump. It is brutal. In a tight pack if you get a lightning you should stay behind and save it for the last lap to minimise risk of a counter attack on you next lap.
- [**Advanced**] Learn that parts of the course that loop back on themselves lend themselves to red shells that can be fired and travel over the wall to get opponents way ahead.

## Sherbert Land (Penguins)

- If a hunt the leader is coming, you can avoid it by going to the right of the hill on the open plain before the cave. Timing this is difficult, and needs luck to be in the right general area. Watch out next lap (which you can use tactically with practice).
- Good places to leave bananas include the entrance/exit of the tunnel.

## Royal Raceway (Royal)

- If you get lightning'd before the jump and you aren’t able to stop and go over the jump then hit the brakes just before landing on the opposite bank so you plop directly into the water, as is slightly faster than rolling down the bank.
- If a hunt the leader goes over the jump as the leader is in the air, it will land and wait for them, but they will not get hit by it. You can use this as defence when leading, and should keep it in mind when attacking.
- If there is a lightning in play and you are not leading the pack (meaning someone else will likely get targeted by the lightning as they are going for the jump), you can use the second zipper as a defence (you are invincible when you are on it). You can turn and ram repeatedly into the wall and stay on the booster for several seconds, meaning you won’t be lightning’d and now can make a break for the jump. Keep this in mind when attacking.
- [*Experimental*] If you hop just before the end of the ramp and keep the hop button held down you won't bounce on landing (which is bad as it can put you over the boxes).

## Bowser’s Castle (Bowser’s)

- The two jumps are an ideal place to lightning people. Learn to brake and triple tap (back to full speed) to throw off people's timing, and don't forget a hop can save you (see driving tips).
- If you have multiple people ahead of you, it can be wise to let the leader over the jump and then lightning them in to the second jump (harder to do though) so the people behind may go in on the second jump.

## D.K.’s Jungle Parkway (DKs)

- If you are lightning'ed just as you hit the zipper, put your brakes on fully and you'll fall to the track below rather than going in the water. If you have weapons this can help you attack others and provides more control for taking the jump.
- You should angle yourself when you hit the jump to cut off some of the track on the other side. Aim to hit the boxes by hitting the ramp on the very right side and tilting your cart to the front left corner of the ramp.
- There is a second good place to lightning people where there is an open corner just after some boxes where you can slide people into the river if they aren't paying attention.


## Yoshi Valley (Yoshi)

- It takes practice but you need to learn the jump shortcut to be competitive against good racers. There is a section of the course right after all the maze sections reconnect where there are some boxes straight ahead and the course loops back on itself on the left side. You can jump from up high to down low to save vital seconds. Watch out for lightnings (and learn to feint if there is one so they pull it and you stay on the track).
- [**Advanced**] There are two routes that are fast but the better one is 1st right, 1st left, over the bridge and round. However, you should learn other routes in case there are unavoidable boobie traps on the primary route. I prefer 1st left then over the thin road straight ahead as it has more boxes, but for pure racing speed 1st left 1st right 1st left is faster if you can avoid the mites.
- [**Advanced**] On the primary route you can throw a banana chain forward just after you've turned left to go over the bridge. They'll land on the track above on the run up to the jump!
- [**Advanced**] You can get over the jump from a standing start if you have a boost. If you get hit just before the jump you can AB-spin to the correct angle and boost over.
- [**Advanced**] A box can be placed hanging in mid air on the jump shortcut which can obstruct people (and is more hidden than on the accelerator)
- [**_Expert_**] It is possible to make the jump when you are small, if you have time to get to full speed and do a power slide and then use the power slide boost right at the edge. However it is risky!

## Banshee Boardwalk (Bansh)

- Lightnings work well to target people on the chicane corner before the ledge jump down to the house entrance, but also work well as people go in to the house. if a bat flies into them it will squash them.
- [**Advanced**] If you are first to enter the house and you have been lightning'ed to be small, if you turn right then go right over to the wall you can drive down the right hand side of the bats without being squashed. You can the drive in front of where they come out and are immune to being squashed here too. Take the next turn tightly to avoid the next set of bats.
- [**Advanced**] If you are not first and are small entering the house then crossing the bat line is a big risk, you can go dow the left side of the bats if you can squeeze around the corner tightly and have a bit of luck.
- [**Advanced**] Inside the ghost house after the right turn there is a cavern on the left. You can hop over this fairly easily with practice and it will save you some time. Good place to lay booby traps against other players.
- [**Advanced**] Inside the ghost house after the right turn there is a chasm on the left. You can hop over this fairly easily with practice and it will save you some time. Good place to lay booby traps against other players.		 +- [**Advanced**] Inside the ghost house after the right turn there is a cavern on the left. You can hop over this fairly easily with practice and it will save you some time. Good place to lay booby traps against other players.
 -- [*Experimental*] If you mushroom boost over the gap in the house you don't need to hop.

## Rainbow Road

We don't race this as it is long and boring. You should just concentrate on dodging the chomp, and taking a strong racing line. Pure racing to win the day.
